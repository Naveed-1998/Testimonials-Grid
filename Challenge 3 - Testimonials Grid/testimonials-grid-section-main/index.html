      <p class="box-1-paragraph-2 paragraph-2">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
        looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
        amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
        found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
        weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of my life. Since
        completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as
        a software engineer at a VR startup."

        <p class="box-4-paragraph-2 paragraph-2">"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find

          junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the

        <p class="box-5-paragraph-2 paragraph-2">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
          needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
          The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
          hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
          next level in a way that no tutorial ever could have. In fact, I've
          often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
          developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
